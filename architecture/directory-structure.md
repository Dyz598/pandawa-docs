# Directory Structure

### Root Directory

```

├── bootstrap
├── config
├── public
├── src
├── storage
├── tests
└── vendor
```

This section will cover the directory structure of Pandawa and its best practices
in how to organize your code more neatly.

Since Pandawa extends the Laravel framework there are still some directories and code files 
from Laravel that was kept with the same purpose.

- **bootstrap:** Contains all files to bootstrap the framework and all cached framework and
application files to optimize performance. You usually should not modify files here.
- **config:** Contains all the application's configuration files and all your `Bundle` classes
to register to your application in `bundles.php`.
- **public:** Contains the `index.php` file which is the entry point for requests into your applications.
- **src:** Contains all the core code of your applications which will be explained more in detail and its best
practices soon.
- **storage:** Contains logs or file caches generated by the framework. The folder is also used
to store files generated by the application.
- **tests:** Contains your Unit and Feature tests for your application using [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/). 
Run the tests using `phpunit` or `./vendor/bin/phpunit` command.
- **vendor:** Contains your [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) packages/dependencies.

### Src Directory

This section will cover the `src` directory in how to organize your code
and learning best practices to organize it more neatly.

Currently, we have two ways to organize your code the **Standard Way** and the
**Domain Driven Design Way**.

#### Standard Way
